Naive bayes


1- Load data
 Split data in training set and testset

2- Summarize 

 Divide data on bases of class
 Write functions for the mean and stad deviation
 Find mean and deviation for each aatributes (Divide by calll as well)
 ex  We have 3 attributes(2,4,3)
		the mean and std devition will be like ([[m1,std1],[m2,std2],[m3,std3]])
3- Prepare algo

	write function to calculate PDF inputs : x,mean and std return: data with pdf
	calculate combine probability by using multiple theorem of probability (Clear your doubts)
	Store the Probability and Sort them in descending order
